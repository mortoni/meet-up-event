# Meet-Up-Event
Meet-Up Event Planner, Project 1 from Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree. It's a responsive app with validation and user experience.  
### Requirement  
> You will build a responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event. The goal is to create an app that is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. The application must allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.
